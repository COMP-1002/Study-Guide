# Study Guide

Welcome to the COMP 1002 Student Study Guide.
<br>This is a collaborative effort that began in the Spring 2023 term.

Access the guide: [Study Guide Wiki](https://github.com/COMP-1002/Study-Guide/wiki/COMP-1002-Student-Study-Guide)

## How to get Bonus Marks

1. Register for GitHub and use Brightspace mail to email me your GitHub username. 
   <br>Make sure your username is university appropriate.
   <br>Put "COMP 1002: GitHub username" as the email title.
2. Go to the [Project Todo! List](https://github.com/orgs/MUN-COMP-1002/projects/1) to see the available tasks for extra credit.
3. Assign yourself to an unassigned task marked with the status Todo. 
   <br>Mark its status as In Progress.
   <br>Note: Only one student may complete a task.
4. Complete the task in the [Study Guide Wiki](https://github.com/COMP-1002/Study-Guide/wiki/COMP-1002-Student-Study-Guide)
<br>To do this, navigate to the appropriate page, then edit the page and insert your work.
<br>You may have to go to Brightspace to find the problem you are solving. 
<br>The editing is in Markdown and the wiki pages should allow for you to upload files by drag-and-drop.
<br>Make sure you have the problem question, the solution, and explanation (if required as per the job description).
5. Go back to the [Project ToDo List](https://github.com/orgs/MUN-COMP-1002/projects/1) to mark that task's status as Done.
6. Profit? I'll update the marks every Monday.

It is important to note that your Bug Bonus/Study Guide contribution score cannot exceed 2 points.
<br>You are welcome to contribute as much as you want -- you just cannot get more credit than the 2 points.
<br>Additionally, you cannot do more than one task per topic (i.e. only one PL task).
