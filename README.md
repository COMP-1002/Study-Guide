# Study Guide

Welcome to the COMP 1002 Student Study Guide.
<br>This is a collaborative effort that began in the Spring 2023 term.
<br>The guide contains How-Tos, exercise solutions & hints, and general advice.

[Register for GitHub](https://github.com/signup). Email me your username via Brightspace.
<br>Make sure your username is university appropriate.
<br>Put "COMP 1002: GitHub username" as the email title.
<br>I will try to grant access to those who do this daily.
<br>After registering, access the guide: [Study Guide Wiki](https://github.com/COMP-1002/Study-Guide/wiki)

## How to get Bonus Marks

1. Make sure you have access to the repository! (See instructions above how to register)
2. Go to the [Project Todo! List](https://github.com/orgs/MUN-COMP-1002/projects/1) to see the available tasks for extra credit.
3. Assign yourself to an unassigned task marked with the status Todo. 
   <br>Do this with the down-arrow in the Assignee column and enter your username.
   <br>Mark its status as In Progress.
   <br>Note: Only one student may complete a task.
4. Complete the task in the [Study Guide Wiki](https://github.com/COMP-1002/Study-Guide/wiki/COMP-1002-Student-Study-Guide)
<br>To do this, navigate to the appropriate page, then edit the page and insert your work.
<br>You may have to go to Brightspace to find the problem you are solving. 
<br>The editing is in Markdown and the wiki pages should allow for you to upload files by drag-and-drop.
<br>Make sure you have the problem question, the solution, and explanation (if required as per the job description).
5. Go back to the [Project ToDo List](https://github.com/orgs/MUN-COMP-1002/projects/1) to mark that task's status as Done.
6. Profit? I'll update the marks at the end of the term.
<br> You will only get credit for **correct** submissons.

It is important to note that your Bug Bonus/Study Guide contribution score cannot exceed 2 points.
<br>You are welcome to contribute as much as you want -- you just cannot get more credit than the 2 points.
<br>Additionally, you cannot do more than one task per topic (i.e. only one PL task).
