<br>The editing is in markdown (similar to HTML) and the wiki pages should allow for you to upload files by drag-and-drop.
<br>Make sure you have the problem question, the solution, and explanation (if required as per the job description).
5. Go back to the [Project ToDo List](https://github.com/orgs/MUN-COMP-1002/projects/1) to mark that task's status as Done.
