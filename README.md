## How to get Bonus Marks
After you tell me who you are (tell me your username after class or Brightspace mail)...
1. Go to the [Project ToDo List](https://github.com/orgs/MUN-COMP-1002/projects/1) to see the available tasks for extra credit.
2. Assign yourself to an unassigned task. Mark its status as In Progress.
3. Complete the task in the [Study Guide Wiki](https://github.com/MUN-COMP-1002/Study-Guide/wiki)
<br>To do this, navigate to the appropriate page, then edit the page and insert your work.
<br>The editing is in markdown (similar to HTML) and the wiki pages should allow for you to upload files by drag-and-drop.
4. Go back to the [Project ToDo List](https://github.com/orgs/MUN-COMP-1002/projects/1) to mark that task's status as Done.
5. Profit?

It is important to note that your Bug Bonus/Study Guide contribution score cannot exceed 2 points.
<br>You are welcome to contribute as much as you want -- you just cannot get more credit than the 2 points.
